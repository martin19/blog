## Interloper, Carbon Based Lifeforms
Starts out pretty intense, dive right into the forest, can you imagine the northern scenery, pretty lonely but self sufficient. its easy to forget time with this, however the rumbling of the bass emits just enough energy to fall into meditative state. winteresque, forestal, cbl classic

## Abiogenesis, Carbon Based Lifeforms
Starts out with beautiful underwater textures, adlibs are not exactly unobtrusive but just hook enough not to decouple from reality before the main part kicks in, bass is rumbling and wont let you go, melody line is addictive, fits well with adlibs in 3rd part. Meditative qualities, however too engaging to drift.

## Around the world in a tea daze, Ott remix, Shphongle
What is so addictive about this song? every time you hear it you are sucked into clouds of haze and smoke. Imagine the power of mighty ocean waves, vast desert landscape, giant sky. Hallucination inducing soundscapes, hypnotizing melodic patterns complemented by different voices of equal properties. Just close your eyes, or even leave them open and leave reality for this awesome mind round the world trip.

## Castle in the blue sky, Galaxy (Boris Blenn)
This is the first and last release under the name Galaxy, but what a production this is!
The hypnotic qualities of about every song on this album are outstanding. Castle in the blue sky repeats everchanging melody lines on a comfortingly repetitive hypnotic bed of basses. The melodies although ever repeating are never boring meandering into infinite space. Most galaxy songs are true to their name and spark images of galaxies, stars, sparks in the sky.

## Sunrise at aguas blancas, Galaxy (Boris Blenn)
The feel of this track is so calm and relaxing, no beats, just the smooth calm rhythm of the sea, soft waves merging into the sand. Enjoy this new day, there are things to come but everything that matters now is this moment, watch the reflections of the sun, dive into this soft lights, waves, ðŸŒ… 

## Everlasting tone, Galaxy (Boris Blenn)
Probably my favourite galaxy track. The inspirational power of this glassy bell melody line together with a strong calm comforting bassline is just insanely addicting and truly - for me - everlasting. There are many work tracks that get stale after a while and lose their interestingness, not this one: I cannot count how many ideas and code I've written to this song, I should really thank the artist for igniting so many thoughts. My perfect work track, but should equally well go with your favourite meditative task at hand.
